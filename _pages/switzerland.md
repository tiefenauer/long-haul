intro: | 
    My wife and I like to travel and although there are still many white spots on our world map we can say with confidence we have seen a bit of the world. Each year we try to do at least one trip, often leading us abroad. Travelling to other countries made me realize two things:
    
    * There are a lot of beautiful places in the world
    * I don't need to go far away to see some of them

Having become aware of this, we decided to spend our holidays at home one year, travelling along the [Grand Tour of Switzerland](http://grandtour.myswitzerland.com/de/) by car during two weeks (which I can only recommend if you happen to be/live in Switzerland). The route lead us to some stunning views and reinfoced us in our belief: Behold, the good lies so close at hand. Knowing this we started making excursions during the weekend, some small, some big, sometimes by motorbike, often including hiking. What we needed were some destionations. They did not not need to be super-fancy, but take me to nice places all over the country. For this, I found it helpful if I got a tip from a friend or in a newspaper.  

## Why this page?

To us, Switzerland is one of the most beautiful countries in the world. It is maybe only matched by New Zealand, where we drove around with a camper for some weeks. It was there when we discovered [NZ Frenzy](http://www.nzfrenzy.com/), a book by Scott Cook full of ideas where to go and how to get there. A lot of those suggestions take you off the beaten path and that is where you often find some absolute gems. 

During our short trips we would send pictures to family and friends and after some time, they started asking us about ideas where to go next. So day I decided to do the same as Scott, writing a "_NZ frenzy_", only for Switzerland (hence the name _Switzerland Frenzy_). I started collecting the destionations I have been to, documenting how to get there, things to do and see there, adding pictures and put everything online. 

## Who is this for?

If you ask me, Switzerland is perfect if you are into hiking or spending some quality time in the nature. Unlike New Zealand, Switzerland does not have a shore, but then again, Switzerland has the better weather :smile:. And in contrast to NZ, a lot of the hiking trails lead you around in circles, so you don't have to go back the same way you came from (a thing I did not like about NZ). 

I know there are already a lot of guidebooks available, but those only cover the absolute go-tos for tourists who only stay here for a short time. What I am hoping to achieve is a list of ideas for people who live here. The collection is still growing and if there is a destination you would like to suggest, feel free to [drop me a line](/contact).

I hope you find my collection useful. Have fun exploring my home country!
