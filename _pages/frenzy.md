intro: | 
    My wife and I like to travel and although there are still many white spots on our world map we can say with confidence we have seen a bit of the world. Each year we try to do at least one trip, often leading us abroad. Travelling to other countries made me realize two things:
    
    1. There are a lot of beautiful places in the world
    2. I don't need to go far away to see some of them

    Without further ado, here are our favourite getaways (list still growing):

## Why this page?

Having become aware of above two facts, one year we decided to spend more of our holidays inland, travelling along the [Grand Tour of Switzerland](http://grandtour.myswitzerland.com/de/) by car during two weeks (which I can only recommend if you happen to be/live in Switzerland). The route lead us to some stunning views and reinfoced us in our belief: Behold, the good lies so close at hand. Knowing this we started making excursions during the weekend, some small, some big, sometimes by motorbike, often including hiking. What we needed were some destionations. They did not not need to be super-fancy, but take me to nice places all over the country. For this, I found it helpful if I got a tip from a friend or in a newspaper.

Over the years we have collected quite a few spots we like to go during weekends. Because we would often send pictures to family and friends, after some time, they started asking us about ideas where they go next. Therefore one day I started collecting our favourite destionations I, documenting how to get there, things to do and see there, adding pictures and put everything online.

## Why the name?

To us, Switzerland is one of the most beautiful countries in the world, maybe only matched by New Zealand, where we drove around with a camper for some weeks. It was there when we discovered [NZ Frenzy](http://www.nzfrenzy.com/), a book by Scott Cook full of ideas where to go and how to get there. A lot of those suggestions take you off the beaten path and that is where you often find some absolute gems. I borrowed part of the name as a homage to Scott's fantastic work.

## Who is this for?

If you ask me, Switzerland is perfect if you are into hiking or spending some quality time in the nature. Unlike New Zealand, Switzerland does not have a shore, but then again, Switzerland has the better weather :smile:. And in contrast to NZ, a lot of the hiking trails lead you around in circles, so you don't have to go back the same way you came from (a thing I did not like about NZ). 

I know there must already be a gazillion lists and guides like (or better than) mine. My contribution is supposet do be a personal reference of the places we have been to, not some generic content. May it help the curious reader/traveller. The collection is still growing and if there is a destination you would like to suggest, feel free to [drop me a line](/contact).

I hope you find my collection useful. Have fun exploring my home country!
