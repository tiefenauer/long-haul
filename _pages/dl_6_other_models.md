title: "Deep Learning (6/6): Other Models"
intro: |
    When writing these articles, I started out with what I learned in the Coursera Courses. Doing so helped structuring the content into topics and so much of what is written in chapters 1 to 5 more or less follows the syllabus from Coursera. However, there is a lot more to explore in Deep Learning. DL is a very active field of research and so there is no shortage of new concepts, ideas or approaches. This page serves as a bucket to collect knowledge about those topics that were either left out completely or only treated superficially in the Coursera courses (or maybe did not even exist when the course was launched).
