My blog on [tiefenauer.info](http://www.tiefenauer.info) containing some personal thoughts, ideas, tutorials and things I do not want to forget.

This is relaunch of my old blog. Most of the content was migrated. You can still find the old blog [here](http://legacy.tiefenauer.info).

The website uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Long Haul Theme](https://github.com/brianmaierjr/long-haul) with some adjustments. Formulas are written with [Mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/) and some page elements use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). Some pages use [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) for users to make annotations directly on the page. The comment system is powered by [Disqus](https://disqus.com/).
