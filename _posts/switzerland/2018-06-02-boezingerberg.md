This weekend we made a motorcycle trip to Biel, a city that lies exactly on a language border. The city is famous for its watch industry and it is not uncommon to hear German and French in equal parts. For the locals the Bözingerberg is a popular destination. 

The hike starts with a passage of 90 minutes uphill. A lot of path is in the forest, which was good considering the hot and humid weather. The path leads you through a small park where you can have a picnic and watch/feed domestic animals (deer, ibex, marmots and the like). On top there is a restaurant where you can have an ice cream or something (the Rösti also looked good :stuck_out_tongue:). You get a stunning view down to the Lake Biel and the Mittelland (flat region of Switzerland). On a clear day you can see the Alps.   

The way back is also through the forest for the greater part. The hike culminates in the last passage that takes you through the Taubenlochschlucht (_Pigeon Hole Gorge_). Back in Biel you can relax in the public seaside bath, which is very nice.
