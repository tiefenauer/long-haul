Belalp is an alp above the village of Naters. Its proximity to the Aletsch Glacier (UNESCO world heritage) makes it a popular destination in both summer and winter. There is a road up there but it is not open to the public, so you will have to take the funicular from Blatten, a village which belongs to Naters.

Up there are endless possibilities to hike, enjoy the million dollar view on the Glacier, marvel at the traditional old chalets or have a drink in one of the restaurants. You can rent a scooter to get down to Blatten again which saves you money and is also more fun!
