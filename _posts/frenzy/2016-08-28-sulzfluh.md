The Sulzfluh is a summit on the border between Switzerland and Austria. You can start in St. Anthönien and walk up to the Carschina hut where you can stay overnight (reservation required). From there you can climb up to the summit the next morning. The path does not require abseiling, but be aware that it will become very steep the closer you get to the summit. The last part involves some serious rock-climbingwhere you need to hold yourself on chains that have been installed there. But the view is wortth the stresses and strains. On the way back you can rent a scooter in Partnun and ride back to St. Anthönien.
