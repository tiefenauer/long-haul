The Faux-d'Enson is a hill with a tower from which you havae a pretty decent view of the Jura. It is located only minutes away from the village of Roche-d'Or but I suggest you start near Réclère where you will find enough parking and at the [Prehistoric Park](http://www.prehisto.ch) which includes some caves. The caves are only open for a fee and only accessible in guided tours with commentary in French and German. Those take place only twice a day (except for Sunday) so make sure to get some information about the schedule beforehand.

The park also includes a camground if you are into camping. From there, the path leads you uphill through Roche-d'Or. After 1-2 hours you will reach the tower. Have a snack, enjoy the view but beware the cows who graze in the open field around the tower. Since the Tower is situated pretty much exactly on the border to France, you can continue your journey on the French side. However, the area is pretty remote and there are not many signposts, so make sure you bring a map.
