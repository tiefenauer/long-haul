The Calanda is the landmark mountain of the city of Chur. From Haldenstein it goes uphill for 2500 meters. You can either do the tour in one day and have sore legs the next day. Or you can stay in the Calanda hut (reservation needed!). The hill is very steep and the ascent is constant without any flat parts in between so make sure you bring enough water, food and wear good shoes! But the hassle is worth it: From up there you have a fantastic view over the various surrounding valleys.
