The Furka pass connects the cantons of Uri and Valais. The road itself is closed during winter but opens up for the public in June (if the snow has thawed). The road itself is stunning enough and very popular with motorcyclists. However, there is another gem to be explored right next to the road. In the restaurant Belvédère you can purchase tickets to visit the Glacier from which the river Rhone springs, the main river of the canton of Valais. And with visit I mean actually go inside the glacier (they dug a cave inside the glacier). The path is not very long but that is good since it's freezing in there. However, this might be just what you need on a hot summer day.
