The Reuss is a river with its source in the Alps near the Furka. It flows through Bremgarten, a pretty little town in the canton of Aargau. The reuss (as many other rivers in Switzerland) is very popular with rafters. On a hot summer day the river is full of rubber boats and stand-up paddles. Sometimes people float down there just using swim rings or pool noodles but beware: the Reusss can become pretty wild and I wouldn't go down there without a proper boat and air jackets.

You will need two cars to do this trip: one you can park in Gebenstorf near the bridge over the Reuss. The parking lot belongs to a restaurant that lets people park there for a small fee, even without consuming anything.

There is an embarking point on the lower end of the old town of bremgarten with some parking spots nearby. Those are filled pretty fast in nice weather so be sure to arrive early. From there you can let yourself float downstream. A lot of the river flows through a nature-sanctuary, so enjoy the view from the boat, listen to the birds an the waves and don't forget to cool yourself down in the water from time to time. There are plenty of (official and unofficial) places to make a fire along the shore. Sometimes there are even small sand banks. If you take a tent with you you can stay in one of the campgrounds near the river.

Make sure to disembark in Gebenstorf just after the bridge with the statue on it (where you parked your car). The disembarking place is a public bath (free entrance) with toilets, so you can deflate your boat and relax for an hour or so before returning to Bremgarten with the other car.

**Be sure to disembark in Gebenstorf as ther is a dangerous embankment just after the public bath which is not traversable by boat.**
