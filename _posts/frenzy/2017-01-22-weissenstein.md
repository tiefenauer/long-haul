The Weissenstein is mountain near the city of Solothurn. It is easily accessible by car. Alternatively, you can park your car near the valley station of the funicular and take a ride up there. In winter you can go sledging or cross-country skiing, which makes it a popular choice to escape the foggy weather in the lower parts of Switzerland. But the mountain is also a safe bet in summer. You can hike to the Hasenmatt peak. The view over the Mittelland is fantastic and on a clear day you can easily see the Alps. There are various restaurants along the way, so you won't starve.
