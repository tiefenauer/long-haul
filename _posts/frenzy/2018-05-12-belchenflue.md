The [Belchenflue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belchenflue) is a summit located on the border between the canton of Basel-Land and Solothurn. There is a twisting road over the Chilchzimmersattel nearby leading from Eptingen to Langenbruck that I have driven several times by motorbike without noticing the peak. From the road it is only 15 minutes to the top but I recommend you start in the quiet town of Langenbruck.

The path is well signed and leads you uphill for 2 hours. Some of the rout leads through forest and there are some nice spots to rest. If you prefer a restaurant there is the _Dürstel_ pretty much in the middle. On the summit you get a mind-blowing view of the Jura and the Mittelland. There are also some caves called Drachenloch (_dragon hole_) you can explore.

From there you have the option for a small detour to the restaurant _Berghaus Oberbölchen_, which is popular with motorcyclists especially in summer.

The way back leads you along the Geissflue back to Langenbruck. There are again plenty of picnic places along the path where you can roast a sausage or explore the ancient ruins of fortifications built during WW1. If you're lucky you might even spot some chamois who roam there. Back in Langenbruck there is a Kneipp path where you can refresh your feet.

## How to get there
Coming from Olten or Solothurn on the crossing of Härkingen take the A2 in direction of Basel and then right afterwards exit 14 (Egerkingen). Then continue to Langenbruck.

Coming from Basel it is probably easiest if you take exit 13 (Eptingen) and start somewhere in Eptingen. There is only limited parking on the Chilchzimmersattel.
