The Saut du Doubs is a waterfall in the Doubs, a river which separates Switzerland from France. The waterfall is easy accessible from Les Brenets, where you can board a boat. The boat ride will only take 30 minutes and drop you off only minutes away from the waterfall. You can either choose to stay there for an hour or so and take the same boat back. Or you can walk along the Doubs. The border region is a national park and perfect for hiking.
