The Ponte dei Salti (_bridge of jumps_) is a bridge over the Verzasca River in Lavertezzo in the canton of Ticino. During the hot summer days it is a very popular spot for locals and tourists alike who try to cool down near the water. Just pick a spot on the rocks which were smoothed by the water and look quite peculiar. The area features countless places to put your towel, roast a sausage and take a dip in the surreal clear water. If you dare you can even jump from the bridge (check the water level first). But be aware that the water is freezing cold, even in summer. Because of the popularity of the are, it can be difficult to find parking close by. Be sure to arrive early, park somewhere further down the valley or come by public transport.
