The Schnebelhorn is the highest mountain in the canton of Zurich (1292m). You can park your car in Wald and keep walking up. The restaurant [Alpwirtschaft Tierhag](https://www.lvpfaeffikon.ch/alp-schnebelhorn/restaurant/) is on the way and very inviting for an ice cream or something before you walk the last few meters up to the top. From there you can walk down to the village of Steg.
