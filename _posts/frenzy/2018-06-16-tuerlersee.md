The Türlersee is a small lake (more a pond) near Zurich and popular for locals who want to get out in the green during the weekend. I often come here to relax, enjoy the sun and go swimming. Because of its size the water warms up faster than in big lakes, which makes it swimmable already early in summer season. There's also usually a guy renting out stand up paddles. If you are not into water sports theres a walking trail which takes you around the lake in approximately one hour.

There is a very nice public bath, which costs 5.- per person, not including the parking. Come by motorbike if you can: the parking is free and you won't have to search a parking spot. Due to its proximity to Zurich it fills up quite fast sunny days, so make sure you come early. The bath belongs to a campground where you can also buy ice cream, all kinds of food and drinks.

If you don't want to pay there are some spots arount the lake where you can access the water for free. However, you won't be alone there either :) However, be aware that the lake is surrounded by a nature reserve so be sure to enter the water only at the designated spots.
