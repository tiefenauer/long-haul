Biaufond is a collection of houses belonging to the village of Les Bois. However, Biaufond is situated a few kilometers apart from the village, directly at the river Doubs who forms the border between France and Switzerland. The [Maison Biaufond](http://www.maison-biaufond.ch) is a nice restaurant which specializes on dishes with fresh trout caught in the river. You can also rent one of the rooms and stay overnight, but know that the rooms are only very basic. The hosts however are super-friendly and you can use this place as starting point for hikes in the nature reserve spanning along the Doubs.
