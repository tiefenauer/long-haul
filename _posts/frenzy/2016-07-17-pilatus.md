Like [Säntis](/blog/saentis/) or [Schynige platte](/blog/schynige-platte/) this is not an insider tip, but probably the most popular mountain for tourists in Switzerland. Conveniently located in the center of Switzerland near Lucerne it is an all-time favorite with Asian tourists. But you have to hand it to them: the view is world-class. You can get up there from Alpnachstad by cog railway or from Kriens by funicular. In summer you can go hiking, or tobogganing in Fräkmüntegg. In winter there is a popular prepared sleighing route from Fräkmüntegg.
