The S채ntis is actually no insider tip at all, but rather one of the most popular mountains in Switzerland. However I like this part of Switzerland, that's why it is still on the list. I suggest you take the funicular from Schw채galp and start your hiking up there. There are countless destinations, some of which require some serious bouldering.
