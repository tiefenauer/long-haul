The [Seleger Moor](https://www.selegermoor.ch) is a nice garden with lots of flowers between lake Zurich and lake Zug. The are is pretty rural there so it is easy to miss (I actually found out I had already driven past it a few times before). There is parking available so getting there should not be a problem. The park requires an entrance fee, so make sure to bring your wallet. If you like flowers however, your money will be spent wisely.

Inside the park you can walk, enjoy the many plants and spot the occasional frog or duck. You can also bring children as there is a playground and plenty opportunities to play hide and seek. There is also a picnic place where you can put something on the grill. But be sure to be there early (or late) enough as the park is also pretty popular in good weather.
