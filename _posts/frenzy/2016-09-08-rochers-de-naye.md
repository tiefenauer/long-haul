Rochers de Naye is a mountain above Montreux. The easiest way to get up there is to take the cable car, if you don't want to walk. You can still walk down and enjoy the awesome panorama over Lake Geneva. But make sure to bring a torch since the path leads you through some caves (which you can skip if you forget the torch). The caves are pretty wet and slippery even during dry weather and it is a good idea to use a headlight to have both hands free. Also make sure not to wear your best apparel as your clothes might become pretty dirty during the cave exploration.

You won't need a map since you can't really get lost and the path is well signed. If you don't want to walk all the way down to Montreux you can take the funicular again somewhere in the middle. But be aware that it might get pretty crowded during a nice day. In Montreux you can get an ice cream and hang out near the lake.
