The Lago Tremorgio is a small lake above Rodi in the canton of Ticino. You can either walk up there, but I recommend taking the furnicular from Rodi and take a hike up there. You can walk around the lake in 45 minutes or choose a longer hike on one of the surrounding summits. Have a dring in the restaurant near the lake, which is the only building up there except for a cabin (which you can rent!).

If you're down earlier than expected you can take a ride on the cog railway on the other side of the valley in Ambri (which is not far away). It is one of the steepest railways in the world! Up there there is a water supply dam and even more possibilities to hike.
