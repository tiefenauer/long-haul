Like Mount Säntis, this lake is no insider tip at all, at least not for most locals. But man, I love this region. It looks just like from a fairy tail. You can start in Wasserauen and take the funicular up to Ebenalp. From there it is only some 15 minutes to [Berggasthaus Aescher](http://www.aescher-ai.ch/) which became world famous since it appeared on the title cover of National Geographic magazine. But you have to admit: It looks pretty damn spectacular tucked away there under all these rocks. Have a Rösti there, the restaurant's signature dish, if you can find a place to sit. You can even stay overnight if you have a reservation, but due to its popularity this has become quite a challenge.

From the restaurant it is an hour's walk down to the lake and from there another 90 minutes back to Wasserfallen.
