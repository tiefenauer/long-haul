Hoch Ybrig is a group of mountains in the canton of Schwyz. There is a funicular but you can also walk up there. In winter you can co skiing or ice fishing in the small lake (Seeblisee). But the mountains are also scenic in summer. If you pass the restaurant Fuederegg and walk along the way you will find a small hut operated by an alpine herdsman where you can eat a snack and drink something. Sure not many tourists there :smile:
