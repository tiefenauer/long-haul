The [Klöntalersee](https://www.kloental.com/) is a small lake in the canton of Glarus. It is not near any major town, so you are pretty much in the wild there. There is a restaurant and a campground who I expect to be pretty crowded in summer. You can access the lake by car or motorcycle from the city of Glarus but be aware that this is a dead-end road during the weekends which means you have to drive back the same way you came from. Not a bad thing though, because the route is pretty scenic. Take your time though because the road can become very narrow which makes cornering a real challenge at times. Because of the campground you have to expect RVs behind every turn.

The road continues and becomes the [Pragel pass](https://www.alpen-paesse.ch/de/alpenpaesse/pragelpass/), which connects the city of Glarus with the town of Muotathal. However, the pass is only open on weekdays which makes it very popular with cyclists on weekends, because they are the only ones allowed to pass. If you can, go during a weekday, because then the pass is open for general traffic. But be warned: the road is very adventurous, narrow and steep and the tarmac is not always the best. Beside a cheese dairy with a small restaurant there is not much up there. All the better to enjoy the wonderful nature around you!
