St. LÃ©onard is a small town between Sion and Sierre in the canton of Valais. You would probably just drive through if it wasn't for the subterranean lake. It is not big but still pretty impressive, especially the acoustics. Sometimes there are even concerts there with the orchestra on a swimming stage. Since the lake is completely underground the temperature is always pretty much constant, which makes it a popuplar destination regardless of the weathre.
