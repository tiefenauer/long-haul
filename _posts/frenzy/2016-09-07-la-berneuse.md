The Berneuse (_the woman from Bern_) is a mountain near Leysin. In winter you can go skiing and in summer hiking. The area is also popular for mountainbikers, since it features a fenced-off trail exclusively for bikers. Take the funicular to the top and be ready for some jaw-dropping panorama from the restaurant. On clear days you can see from Mont Blanc to Lake Geneva without a problem.
