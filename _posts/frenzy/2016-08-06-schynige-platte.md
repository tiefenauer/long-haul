The Schynige Platte is a mountain above the town of Wilderswil near Interlaken. Although it is very popular, it is probably less frequented than the other attractions nearby, like Brienzer Rothorn, Mt. Eiger, Mt. MÃ¶nch and Mt. Jungfrau. You can take the cog railway up there and enjoy the spectacular view over Lake Thun and Lake Brienz. There are plenty of opportunities for a hike or a snack.
