The Tremola is actually not a place but an old road, but a pretty spectatular one. It is the oldest road of the Gotthard pass and has been replaced by a new road later. Since the Gotthard tunnel is used for traffic nowadays, the Tremola has lost importance. It is however still a scenic road to drive, escpecially considering the cobbled road. If you're lucky you might even see replicas of stage coaches that used to drive there. On the pass summit you can visit an old fortification built during WW2.
